# Basic Pentesting Writeup
Writeup for resolving Basic Pentesting lab from TryHackMe.

### Start
Connect to THM VPN and start the machine

### Port Scan
Run a NMAP scan for solving the open ports and services that are running on them.

```
nmap -sC -sV -T2 <MACHINE-IP> -oN scan.txt
```
Obs: I chose T2 flag to running it in a low speed so I could find more services that are running, T3 speed possibly can do the same.

### Open Ports and Running Services
22 - SSH
80 - HTTP 
139 - Netbios-ssn (smb)
445 - Netbios-ssn (smb)
8009 - ajp3
8080 - http

### Open HTTP (80) service in browser
Just insert the machine IP address in the browser search bar and hit ENTER.
